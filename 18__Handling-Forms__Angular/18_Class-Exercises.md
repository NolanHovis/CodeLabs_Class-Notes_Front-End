1. Download staring code for [class 10 Angular Example](https://github.com/WilderDev/Class-10-Angular-Forms-Example)
2. In the _app.component.html_ file, create a container div with a row inside that renders both of our components side-by-side.
3. Inside the "BookFormTemplateComponent": Create a template-driven form that, when submitted, displays all the relevant data below the form.
   - Title, Author, and Genre should all be required inputs that display an error message with a red border when touched and invalid.
   - Set 'mystery' to be the default value on the genre select box.
   - Use two-way-binding to display the name of the book after the word "Submit" on the submit button.
   - Display the title, author, and genre below the form when a user clicks "Submit". (Also, reset the form.)
4. Inside the "BookFormReactiveComponent": Create a reactive-driven form that, when submitted, displays all the relevant data below the form.

   - Set 'mystery' to be the default value on the genre select box.
   - Display the title, author, and genre below the form when a user clicks "Submit". (Also, reset the form.)
